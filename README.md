## Analysis Summary

### Exploratory Analysis

The analysis focused on three key indicators from the World Development Indicators dataset:
1. Inflation Rate
2. Life Expectancy
3. GDP per Capita

#### Inflation Rate
Across 217 countries, inflation rates varied significantly, with a mean of 12.49% and a standard deviation of 19.68%. Most countries experienced elevated inflation rates, with a right-skewed distribution.

#### Life Expectancy
The average life expectancy was 72.4 years, with values ranging from 53 to 85.4 years. The distribution was slightly left-skewed, indicating most countries have higher life expectancy.

#### GDP per Capita
GDP per Capita showed a right-skewed distribution, with most countries having lower GDP, while a few had significantly higher GDP values. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy.
